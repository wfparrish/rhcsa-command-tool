Started the RHCSA command tool project

to start the frontend, go to the frontend folder and type:
npm start

to start the backend, go to the backend folder and type:
node server.js

Video #1

Created the frontend folder
-added the React app using:
npx create-react-app frontend 

-this created the npm library node_modules the package-lock.json and package.json folder, 
along with a .gitignore file

Created the first video tutorial in the series introducing the problem:

Here is the ChatGPT chat that has the code

Added the Test, Question, and Step components in the frontend folder
Added the backend folder

Added the npm library to the backend
-this created the npm library node_modules the package-lock.json and package.json folder, 
but it didn't create a .gitignore, I'll probably need to add that later

-added the questions.json file
-created the server.js file

For now run:
node server.js
to see the server spin up on http://localhost:5000

So based on the format I have now, I'm updating the questions list

Using ChatGPT to generate the Step questions for the UI using the work I've already
done to create command lists for the questions.

Fixed a bug in the UI where the correct or incorrect textbox wouldn't go away when moving to another question

Created the Github repo for the project:
https://github.com/wfparrish/rhcsa-command-tool.git

using main as the word for the main branch

git push origin main

***************************************************************************

What I think would be cool is if at the bottom of each screen I had a simulated terminal
In that terminal you could enter each command one after another and get the output from them like you would on the Test
It would let you reinforce what you are learning with each separate command entered

12/1

Added about 55 questions to the app
Used the scripts that I wanted to write as the basis, should work nicely with RHCSA objectives and memorization
